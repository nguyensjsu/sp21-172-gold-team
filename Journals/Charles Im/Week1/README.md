### Week 1 (4/15 - 4/22)

Worked on the register entity with Bhavana. 
I wrote the controller and she wrote the reporsity and class for the register.

One issue we encounter was a contextLoads() failure, we will be working on this.
I believe this cause due to some dependency issue.
We are expecting to solve the issue by next group meeting.

We started some work on the mySql but were stymied by the previous problem and the dummy code left.
