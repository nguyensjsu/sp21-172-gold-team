# CMPE 172 Project Journal: Week 3

I had too much workload in week3 from other classes, and I communicated with my team about it. They were willing ease me off with some load, and asked me to work on mySQL database. They told me to upload my lab6 since I got 10/10 on it. Bhavanna started making changes to my lab6 code. Vishnu helped me clean up my front end code.
