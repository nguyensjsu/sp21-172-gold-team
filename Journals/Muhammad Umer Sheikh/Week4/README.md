# CMPE 172 Project Journal: Week 2

Week1: I worked on designed 3 components of the UI:
1) Menu : I used the 5 drinks that was mentioned in the starbucksapi lab. My group and I decided to implement only 5 drinks first, and if we have time we can implement snacks such as cookies and pastries. The UI page is shown below:

2) Account balance page: I used the template provided by the professor under the project description.

3) Sign in: Created a standard sign in page UI with Starbucks scheme.

#### Meetings
No team meetings were held, but Charles from the database team from Team Gold reached out about a problem he was having with application.properties. We tried generating a new gradle project, and try to compare with the old application.properties. Unfortunately, we were not able to solve the problem.

# CMPE 172 Project Journal: Week 1

Week1: I worked on designing the homepage UI for the starbucks website. 
#### Meetings
Last week, we had two meetings in which we assigned ourselves tasks, and let everyone know what we are working on to avoid any confusion.
The meetings were held on: 

1) Friday 4/16 @ 1 pm
2) Thursday 4/22 @ 12 pm
 
#### Challenges
Challenges: The main challenge I encountered was that I did not know HTML. I overcome this challenge by using Adobe XD, and made the UI on it. I then exported Adobe XD file as a html file, and it worked. The html code was generated for me.

My second challenge is to figure out the font and color scheme that is similar to Starbucks UI, so that the UI looks like Starbucks UI.
