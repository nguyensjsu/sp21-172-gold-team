### Week 1:
- Built the StarbucksRegisterRepository.java and StarbucksRegister.java
- Worked with Charles on building the StarbucksRegisterController.java
- We encountered an error as shown in the figure below. We have not been able to fix it yet but expect to fix it by the upcoming weekend and eventually implement the MySQL database instead of H2 database.
